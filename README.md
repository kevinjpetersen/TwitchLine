TwitchLine is a Command Line with integrated Twitch that only plays when it's running commands to take full advantage of work and fun!

# What is this?
TwitchLine is suppose to be a fun alternative to the boring old Command Line Terminal that we all know, by combining fun and work to not waste a single second of time!

Have you ever been sitting around while that boring build is happening in the console, and you think to yourself: "Hmm, I wish I could do something fun right now until this build is finished". Well then this is the thing for you! Presenting, TwitchLine! Watch Twitch while you wait! .. or if you're just in the mood.

Welcome to TwitchLine             |  Change Channels!

# So what can it do?
TwitchLine works as a regular Command Line (CMD) so whatever you're doing should be able to work completely fine with TwitchLine!
The special part about TwitchLine is that it only allows you to watch Twitch as long as a command is running. This is to encourage a healthy work/fun balance.

A few custom commands has been added to "influence" the culture of fun and work!

Name | Command | Descrption
----|----|----------------
Take a Break| IWannaHaveFun | Lets you play the Twitch player for 2 minutes
Anything good on? | channel <Twitch Channel Name> | Changes the channel to the specified Twitch Channel
Stop. Right now! | stop | Stops whatever is going on right now in the TwitchLine, making it available for use immediately!
  
# Why is this a thing?
Honestly, I always wanted to have a Command Line where I could both do my work when needed, but also take advantage of all the time just staring at the black background with white text. Combining this with something like Twitch allowed me to enjoy some good content while only being allowed to do so while I'm basically idle.

# This is awesome! I wanna contribute/have a question
Amazing to hear! Go ahead! Do all the PR's you wanna do. Create all the issues you wanna do. I'll be actively working on this repository to improve the functionality and possibly integrate other services in the future.
